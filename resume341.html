  <h2>About</h2>
  <!-- About me paragraphs subject to change -->
  <p>Hi. My name is Agnes, and I'm from Texas. I am studying Interactive Media and Graphic Design at University of Miami and aim to become a web developer and UX/UI designer in the future.</p>

  <p>I grew up in a fictional sounding place called Sugar Land. It's a quickly growing suburb right outside of Houston. It was there I discovered my drive to always be learning and creating. </p>

  <p>Stories from the likes of Steve Jobs and Sophia Amoroso, and movies like Spirited Away inspire me. I want my work to embody the slogan of one of the most outstanding, "Think Different."</p>
