        <h2>About</h2>
          <!-- About me paragraphs subject to change -->
          <p>Hi. My name is Agnes, and I'm from Texas. I am studying Interactive Media and Graphic Design at the University of Miami and aim to become a web developer and UX/UI designer in the future.</p>
          <p>I grew up in a fictional sounding place called Sugar Land. It's a quickly growing suburb right outside of Houston. It was there I discovered my drive to always be learning and creating. </p>
          <p>Stories from the likes of Steve Jobs and Sophia Amoroso, and movies like Spirited Away inspire me. I want my work to embody the slogan of one of the most outstanding, "Think Different."</p>

          <h3>Animal Shelter Volunteer</h3>
            <p>Winter 2013-2015 </p>

          <ul>
           	<li>Became familiar with the needs and quirks of over 30 cats through frequent volunteering, thus creating an ability to match adoptees with cats that suited their needs.</li>
           	<li>Assisted potential adoption clients by communicating the individual personalities and needs of the cats up for adoption. This increased the likelihood of a good overnight stay when they decided to take a particular cat home, which then increased the chances of the cat getting adopted.</li>
           	<li>Quickly overcame never being around animals by interacting with cats frequently. Played with cats, keeping them in shape and happy, and appealing to adoptees.</li>
           	<li>Kept the cat shelter welcoming and tidy by putting toys and tools in their respective places after using them.</li>
